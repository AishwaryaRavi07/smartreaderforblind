# Smart Reader for Blind - Based on Raspberry Pi 

This project aims to develop a smart reader for blind individuals using a Raspberry Pi. The system captures images, processes them using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and then converts the extracted text into speech, enabling visually impaired users to receive and understand the content.

## Features

- Image capture using camera module connected to Raspberry Pi.
- Image processing to enhance text visibility.
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text extraction.
- Text-to-speech conversion for auditory output.
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction.

## Dependencies

- Raspberry Pi 4
- Camera module compatible with Raspberry Pi
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- Tesseract OCR engine
- pytesseract (Python wrapper for Tesseract)
- Text-to-speech (TTS) engine/library : pyttsx3

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-reader-for-blind.git
